# Ant Movement System Improvements

## Overview

The ant movement system has been completely redesigned to fix issues where ants would get stuck and to make their movement more realistic and smooth. The improvements focus on better physics, obstacle avoidance, stuck detection, and enhanced pheromone trail following.

## Key Issues Fixed

### 1. **Ants Getting Stuck**
- **Problem**: Ants would get trapped in corners or move in tight circles
- **Solution**: Added stuck detection that monitors movement history and triggers escape behavior when ants haven't moved sufficiently over time

### 2. **Unrealistic Movement**
- **Problem**: Ants used completely random movement patterns with instant direction changes
- **Solution**: Implemented steering behaviors with momentum, smooth turning, and realistic wandering patterns

### 3. **Poor Boundary Handling**
- **Problem**: Ants would hit boundaries and get confused
- **Solution**: Added progressive boundary avoidance that starts pushing ants away before they reach the edges

### 4. **Weak Pheromone Following**
- **Problem**: Basic pheromone detection that didn't create smooth trail following
- **Solution**: Enhanced pheromone system with gradient following and weighted influence

## Technical Improvements

### Enhanced Physics Model

**New AntPhysics Fields:**
```rust
pub struct AntPhysics {
    // Existing fields...
    pub desired_direction: Vec2,        // Current movement intention
    pub momentum: f32,                  // Movement persistence (0.95)
    pub last_positions: Vec<Vec2>,      // Recent position history
    pub turn_smoothness: f32,           // How quickly ants can turn (3.0)
    pub wander_angle: f32,              // Current wandering direction
    pub wander_change: f32,             // How much wandering changes per frame
    pub obstacle_avoidance_force: Vec2, // Force for avoiding obstacles
}
```

**Enhanced Movement Features:**
- **Momentum System**: Ants maintain some velocity from previous frames (95% momentum)
- **Smooth Turning**: Gradual rotation changes instead of instant direction snaps
- **Steering Behaviors**: Separate forces for seeking, avoiding, and wandering
- **Realistic Wandering**: Uses a wandering circle technique for smooth, natural-looking exploration

### Stuck Detection & Recovery

**Stuck Detection:**
- Monitors ant position over the last 10 frames
- Calculates total distance moved over recent history
- Triggers escape behavior if total movement < 10 units over 5 samples
- Tracks stuck counter to prevent false positives

**Escape Behavior:**
- Avoids recently visited positions
- Applies boundary avoidance forces
- Adds controlled randomness to break out of patterns
- Uses stronger forces to overcome obstacles

### Improved Memory System

**New AntMemory Fields:**
```rust
pub struct AntMemory {
    // Existing fields...
    pub visited_positions: Vec<Vec2>,   // Recently visited locations
    pub last_stuck_check: i64,         // When stuck detection last ran
    pub stuck_counter: i32,            // How many times ant has been stuck
    pub exploration_radius: f32,       // How far ant explores
    pub path_history: Vec<Vec2>,       // Detailed movement history
}
```

**Memory Features:**
- **Visited Position Avoidance**: Ants remember where they've been and avoid revisiting
- **Path History**: Tracks recent movement for analysis and pathfinding
- **Exploration Mapping**: Helps ants explore new areas systematically

### Enhanced Pheromone System

**Improved Pheromone Detection:**
- **Gradient Following**: Calculates weighted direction from multiple pheromones
- **Type-Based Preferences**: Ants prefer pheromones matching their current state
- **Distance Weighting**: Closer pheromones have more influence
- **Smooth Integration**: Pheromone influence blends with other movement behaviors

**Better Pheromone Creation:**
- **Reduced Frequency**: Creates pheromones every 5 ticks instead of every tick
- **Context-Aware Strength**: Carrying more food creates stronger pheromones
- **Variable Lifespan**: Different pheromone types last different amounts of time
- **Smart Placement**: Only creates pheromones when beneficial

**Pheromone Properties:**
```rust
// Food trails: Strong (80-120), long-lived (1500 ticks), slow decay (0.8)
// Exploration: Weak (25-30), medium-lived (600-800 ticks), fast decay (1.2)
// Home trails: Medium (varies), very long-lived, very slow decay (0.6)
// Danger trails: Strong (150), short-lived (2000 ticks), very fast decay (2.0)
```

### Boundary Avoidance

**Progressive Avoidance:**
- Starts applying gentle forces 50 units from boundaries
- Force strength increases as ant gets closer to edge
- Hard boundary enforcement prevents ants from leaving world
- Bounce behavior when hitting edges

**Boundary Force Calculation:**
- Calculates distance to each boundary
- Applies proportional repulsion force
- Integrates smoothly with other movement forces
- Prevents oscillation near boundaries

## Movement Behavior Details

### Wandering Behavior
- Uses Craig Reynolds' "wandering" steering behavior
- Projects a circle in front of the ant's current direction
- Randomly selects points on the circle's circumference for smooth, natural movement
- Maintains general forward momentum while allowing course corrections

### Targeted Movement
- Smooth pathfinding toward food sources and colonies
- Avoids recently visited areas during pathfinding
- Integrates boundary avoidance into path planning
- Gentler steering when approaching targets to prevent overshooting

### State-Based Movement
- **Wandering**: Smooth exploration with boundary avoidance
- **Seeking Food**: Combines wandering with pheromone following
- **Carrying Food**: Direct pathfinding back to colony with strong pheromone trail creation
- **Following**: Precise movement toward specific positions (pheromone trails)

## Performance Optimizations

### Reduced Computational Load
- Stuck detection runs every 30 ticks instead of every frame
- Pheromone creation limited to every 5 ticks
- Boundary calculations only when near edges
- Memory cleanup prevents unbounded growth of position history

### Smart Pheromone Management
- Automatic merging of nearby pheromones reduces entity count
- Faster decay for exploration pheromones prevents buildup
- Type-specific decay rates optimize trail persistence
- Limited pheromone creation prevents spam

## Configuration Parameters

All movement parameters are tunable for different ant types and behaviors:

```rust
// Physics
max_speed: 50.0,           // Maximum movement speed
acceleration: 100.0,       // How quickly ants can change speed
momentum: 0.95,            // Movement persistence (0.9-0.98)
turn_smoothness: 3.0,      // Rotation speed (1.0-5.0)

// Wandering
wander_change: 0.3,        // Wandering randomness (0.1-0.5)

// Memory
visited_positions: 50,     // Max remembered positions
path_history: 20,          // Max path history length

// Detection
pheromone_sensitivity: 0.5, // Base pheromone detection range multiplier
exploration_radius: 100.0,  // How far ants explore from home
```

## Results

The improved movement system provides:

1. **No More Stuck Ants**: Automatic detection and recovery from stuck situations
2. **Realistic Movement**: Smooth, natural-looking ant behavior with momentum and steering
3. **Better Pathfinding**: Smart navigation that avoids obstacles and revisiting areas
4. **Enhanced Pheromone Trails**: Realistic trail following that creates emergent swarm behavior
5. **Smooth Animation**: No more jerky movement or instant direction changes
6. **Performance**: Optimized calculations that scale well with ant count

The ants now behave like real ants: they explore efficiently, follow pheromone trails naturally, avoid getting trapped, and create realistic emergent swarm intelligence patterns.
